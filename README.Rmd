# FuzzyResampling


The goal of FuzzyResampling, a library written in R, is to provide additional resampling procedures, apart from the classical bootstrap (i.e. Efron's approach, see [@Efron1994]), for fuzzy data.
In the classical approach, secondary samples are drawing with replacement from the initial sample.
Therefore most of these bootstrap samples contain repeated values. Moreover, if the  size of the primary sample is small then all secondary samples consist of only a few distinct values, which is a serious disadvantage.

To overcome this problem, special resampling algorithms for fuzzy data were introduced (see [@grzegorzewski2019; @grzegorzewskietal2020; 
@grzegorzewskiamcs2020;@GrzegorzewskiRom2021;@romaniuk_hryniewicz]).
These methods randomly create values that are "similar" to values from the initial sample, but not exactly the same.
During the creation process, some of the characteristics of the initial fuzzy values are kept (e.g., the value, the width, etc.).
It was shown that these algorithms provide serious advantages in some statistical areas (like standard error
estimation or hypothesis testing) if they are compared with the classical approach.
For detailed information concerning the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these resampling methods please see the above-mentioned references.

The initial sample (in the form of a vector or a matrix) should consist of triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.

Some additional procedures related to these resampling methods are also provided, like calculation of the Bertoluzza et al.'s distance (aka the mid/spread distance, see [@Bertoluzza1995]), estimation of the p-value of the one-sample bootstrapped test for the mean (see [@lubiano2016]), and estimation of the standard error or the mean-squared error for the mean (see [@grzegorzewski2021]).
Additionally, there are procedures which randomly generate trapezoidal fuzzy numbers using some well-known statistical distributions (see [@grzegorzewskietal2020]).

The following procedures are available in the library:

+ Resampling procedures:
  + *ClassicalBootstrap* - classical approach based on Efron's method,
  + *VAMethod* - resampling method which preserves the value and ambiguity (see [@grzegorzewskietal2020]),
  + *EWMethod* - resampling method which preserves the expected value and width (see [@grzegorzewskiamcs2020]),
  + *VAAMethod* - resampling method which preserves the value, left-hand and right-hand ambiguities (see [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021]),
  + *VAFMethod* - resampling method which preserves the value, ambiguity and fuzziness (see [@grzegorzewskietal2020]),
  + *DMethod* - resampling method which preserves the left end of the cores and increments (see [@romaniuk_hryniewicz]),
  + *WMethod* - resampling method which uses the special *w density* to "smooth" the output fuzzy value (see [@romaniuk_hryniewicz]).
  
+ Random generation of the initial samples:  
  + *GeneratorNU* - generation of the initial sample using the normal and uniform distributions (see [@grzegorzewskietal2020]),
  + *GeneratorNExpUU* - generation of the initial sample using the normal, exponential and uniform distributions (see [@grzegorzewskietal2020]),
  + *GeneratorFuzzyNumbers* - generation of the initial sample using various random distributions.
  
+ Applications of the bootstrapped samples:  

  + *OneSampleCTest* - estimation of the p-value of the one-sample test for the mean (see [@lubiano2016]),
  + *TwoSampleCTest* - estimation of the p-value of the two-sample test for the mean (see [@lubiano2016]),
  + *SEResamplingMean* - estimation of the standard error or the mean-squared error for the mean (see [@grzegorzewski2021]).
  
+ Calculation of the characteristics of fuzzy numbers:

  + *CalculateFuzziness* - calculate the fuzziness of fuzzy number (see [@grzegorzewski2019]),
  + *CalculateWidth* - calculate the width of fuzzy number (see [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021]),
  + *CalculateAmbiguity* - calculate the ambiguity of fuzzy number  (see [@grzegorzewski2019]),
  + *CalculateAmbiguityL* - calculate the left-hand ambiguity of fuzzy number (see [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021]),
  + *CalculateAmbiguityR* - calculate the right-hand ambiguity of fuzzy number (see [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021]),
  + *CalculateValue* - calculate the value of fuzzy number (see [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021]),
  + *CalculateExpValue* - calculate the expected value of fuzzy number (see [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021]).
  

+ Additional procedures:
  + *BertoluzzaDistance* - calculation of the Bertoluzza et al.'s distance (aka the mid/spread distance, see [@Bertoluzza1995]),
  + *ComparisonOneSampleCTest* - comparison of resampling methods based on percentage of rejections for the one-sample C-test (see [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021]),
  + *ComparisonSEMean* - comparison of resampling methods based on the SE/MSE for the mean (see [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021]),
  + *ComparePowerOneSampleCTest* - comparison of resampling methods based on percentage of rejections for the one-sample C-test (see [@GrzegorzewskiRom2021]).
