\title{d method for resampling triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers}
\usage{
dmethod(initialSample, b = n, increases = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{initialSample}{Initial sample of triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.}

\item{b}{The number of fuzzy values in the resampled (secondary) sample.
If this parameter is not specified, the number of values in the initial sample is used.
The parameter should be integer value more than 0.}

\item{increases}{If \code{TRUE} is used, then the initial sample should consist of the fuzzy numbers in the form:
 left increment of the support, left end of the core, right end of the core,
right increment of the support. Otherwise, the default value \code{FALSE} is used and the fuzzy numbers should be given in the form:
left end of the support, left end of the core, right end of the core,
right end of the support.}
}
\description{
`dmethod` returns the secondary (bootstrapped) sample and uses the resampling
scheme which does not change the left end of the cores and increments (i.e. length of the core,
 left and right increment of the support) of the fuzzy variables from
 the initial sample (the d method, see (Romaniuk and Hryniewicz, 2019)).
}
\details{
The initial sample should consist of triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, given as a single vector or a whole matrix.
In each row, there should be a single fuzzy number in one of the forms:
\enumerate{
 \item left end of the support, left end of the core, right end of the core, right end of the support, or
 \item left increment of the support, left end of the core, right end of the core, right increment of the support.
}
In this second case, the parameter \code{increases=TRUE} has to be used.

The resampling procedure produces \code{b} fuzzy values.
During the first step, the four values are randomly chosen based on the whole initial sample:
left end of the core, length of the core, left and right increment of the support (with equal probabilities
for each fuzzy variable).
Then the new fuzzy variable, which preserves these characteristics, is created.
If the parameter \code{b} is not specified, it is equal to the length of the initial sample.
The output is given in the same form as the initial sample.

\examples{

# prepare some fuzzy numbers (first type of the initial sample)

fuzzyValues <- matrix(c(0.25,0.5,1,1.25,0.75,1,1.5,2.2,-1,0,0,2),
ncol = 4,byrow = TRUE)

# generate the secondary sample using the d method

dmethod(fuzzyValues)

dmethod(fuzzyValues,b=4)

# prepare some fuzzy numbers (second type of the initial sample)

fuzzyValuesInc <- matrix(c(0.25,0.5,1,0.25,0.25,1,1.5,0.7,1,0,0,2),
ncol = 4,byrow = TRUE)

# generate the secondary sample using the d method

dmethod(fuzzyValuesInc,increases = TRUE)

dmethod(fuzzyValuesInc,b=4,increases = TRUE)
