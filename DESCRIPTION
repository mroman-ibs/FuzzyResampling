Description: The classical (i.e. Efron's) bootstrap is widely used for both the real (i.e. "crisp") and fuzzy data.
 The main aim of the algorithms implemented in this package
 is to overcome a problem with repetition of a few distinct values and to create fuzzy numbers,
 which are "similar" (but not the same) to values from the initial sample.
 To do this, different characteristics of triangular/trapezoidal numbers are kept (like the value, the ambiguity, etc.).
